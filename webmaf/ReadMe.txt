  This is a simple HTML and JavaScript sample video player to demonstrate the WebMAF JavaScript video API
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This sample will cycle through a play-list (see the top of the JavaSctipt inside the HTML file for details) and
provides simple playback controls.  If more than one audio stream or subtitle streams are present the sample
will display extra controls so that these streams can be enabled.

  Please be aware that this software is "work in progress" and is not guaranteed to be bug free or represent
the best practice regarding the implementation of a WebMAF based video service.

  Please feel free to report any issues/queries with this software on the appropriate Devnet support forum.
